# MLProject1
Design binary classifiers – decision tree, kNN, LDA, SVM – using real world data collected from loan applications and compare their performance. Use the PCA to reduce dimensions and check the performance of these classifiers.


# Steps to execute
Follow the steps below to execute the code:-
1. Load the python jupyter notebook named - "Geetika_MSML_Project_Final.ipynb" in Google colab -> https://colab.research.google.com/
2. Upload the two datasets - "TestingData" and "TrainingData" to the files section on the left
3. Run each line of the jupyter notebook

Alternatively, the already ran version of the notebook is also kept in the document - "Geetika_MSML_Project_Final.pdf"

The codes are all labeled and commented for each of the various parts of the project.

Note:-
Backup python file - "geetika_msml_project_final.py" is also kept if you want to run it using another environment but preferred is to use the jupyter notebbok
